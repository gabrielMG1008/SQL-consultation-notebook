# SQL-consultation-notebook
This is a repository to see and remember some SQL queries that I use on a daily basis.
Here are some codes using SQL, I don't explain what each thing does, precisely so that when you consult it, you have to read the code and interpret how it is used.

In the EXAMPLES OF SIMPLE QUERIES, they are queries using select, from, to_date, where, distinct, unique, order by, to_char and others

in the EXAMPLES OF SIMPLE QUERIES PLUS JOIN to all types of joins such as right, left inner outer and others

in the QUERIES USING BASIC SYNTAX we use the following commands SUM, Max, AVG and others

in the SQL FUNCTIONS, in it functions such as to_char, to_date, ascii, concat and others
